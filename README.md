# Hands-On Data Science with Java [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-On Data Science with Java [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-augmented-reality-arcore-and-unity-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789615722), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
ata Scientists enjoy one of the top-paying jobs, with an average salary of $120,000 according to Glassdoor and Indeed. That's just the average! And it's not just about money - it's interesting work too!

If you've got some programming or scripting experience, this course will teach you the techniques used by real data scientists in the tech industry - and prepare you for a move into this hot career path. This comprehensive course includes 68 lectures spanning almost 9 hours of video, and most topics include hands-on Python code examples you can use for reference and for practice. I’ll draw on my 9 years of experience at Amazon and IMDb to guide you through what matters, and what doesn’t.

The topics in this course come from an analysis of real requirements in data scientist job listings from the biggest tech employers. We'll cover the machine learning and data mining techniques real employers are looking for, including:

Regression analysis
K-Means Clustering
Principal Component Analysis
Train/Test and cross validation
Bayesian Methods
Decision Trees and Random Forests
Multivariate Regression
Multi-Level Models
Support Vector Machines
Reinforcement Learning
Collaborative Filtering
K-Nearest Neighbor
Bias/Variance Tradeoff
Ensemble Learning
Term Frequency / Inverse Document Frequency
Experimental Design and A/B Tests
and much more! There's also an entire section on machine learning with Apache Spark, which lets you scale up these techniques to "big data" analyzed on a computing cluste

## Instructions and Navigation
### Assumed Knowledge
To fully benefit from the coverage included in this course, you will need:<br/>
Software developers or programmers who want to transition into the lucrative data science career path will learn a lot from this course.
Data analysts in the finance or other non-tech industries who want to transition into the tech industry can use this course to learn how to analyze data using code instead of tools. But, you'll need some prior experience in coding or scripting to be successful.
If you have no prior coding or scripting experience, you should NOT take this course - yet. Go take an introductory Python course firs
